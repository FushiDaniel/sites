            <h3>üìç USIM</h3>
            <p>HackINSAN is Malaysia‚Äôs inaugural high school hackathon<br> where 
                participants are expected to come up with creative  <br>solutions in response to 
                challenges provided. </p>
            <p>
                During the hackathon day, my team tackled the challenge of <br>increasing 
                insurance awareness among Gen Z, as their interest  <br>in the topic remains low.
                <br> <br>
                Our solution was to create an interactive metaverse world <br> where users could 
                explore and learn about insurance in a fun, engaging way.
                <br><br>
                I had the opportunity to present our concept, and we were <br> thrilled to 
                win first place in the sponsor category and second place overall.
